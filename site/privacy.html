<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> May 18, 2025</p>

<h2>What We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Email address when you join the waitlist or access premium features</li>
  <li>Uploaded files (e.g., TikTok data exports)</li>
  <li>Basic technical metadata (e.g., browser type, file format, upload timestamps)</li>
  <li>Interaction logs related to usage of the platform’s features</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Your Data Is Used</h2>
<p>
  HumanTone uses uploaded content to provide individual insights and visualizations. Additionally, anonymized data may contribute to broader, aggregated trend analysis—helping power features like usage dashboards, behavioral heatmaps, or tag discovery tools that reflect general creator activity.
</p>
<p>
  These insights are designed to improve the platform for everyone and are always built on de-identified, aggregated data. We do not share or sell your personal or raw uploaded data to external parties.
</p>

<h2>Data Aggregation and Privacy</h2>
<p>
  All analysis at the platform level is conducted using anonymous data. Uploads are processed to remove identifying elements such as email addresses, usernames, or timestamps before any form of aggregation occurs. The result is collective intelligence, not individual profiling.
</p>

<h2>Trends and Commercial Use</h2>
<p>
  Over time, HumanTone may offer access to de-identified, aggregate-level insights to external parties—such as for trend reporting, platform studies, or analytics partnerships. Any such data will be statistical in nature, contain no personal identifiers, and will not permit tracing back to any specific user or dataset.
</p>

<h2>Age and Identity</h2>
<p>
  We do not actively collect or verify the age of users. HumanTone is intended for general audiences, and we do not knowingly store data belonging to children under the age of 13. If such data is identified, it will be removed upon request.
</p>

<h2>API and Developer Usage</h2>
<p>
  Developers using our API may only access data tied to their authenticated accounts. Use of the API is monitored and restricted to prevent unauthorized storage, resale, or misuse of any uploaded content or user data.
</p>

<h2>Your Control and Choices</h2>
<p>
  You can request deletion of your uploaded files or account-linked information at any time by contacting <a href="mailto:support@nobosoftware.com">support@nobosoftware.com</a>. Please note that insights already incorporated into anonymized datasets may persist as part of aggregated trends.
</p>

<h2>Updates to This Policy</h2>
<p>
  We may revise this policy as the product evolves. Changes will be reflected on this page, and the “Last updated” date will be adjusted accordingly. Your continued use of the platform constitutes acceptance of the most current version.
