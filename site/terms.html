<h2>Use of Service</h2>
<p>
  HumanTone.me offers tools to help users interpret and visualize their exported platform data (e.g., from TikTok), providing trends, usage insights, and aggregated analytics. You agree to use the service lawfully and responsibly, and not to interfere with platform operations, upload unauthorized material, or attempt to reverse-engineer or misuse the system or API.
</p>

<h2>Uploads and Data Contribution</h2>
<p>
  You remain the owner of any content you upload to HumanTone. By using the platform, you grant us permission to process and anonymize that data so it may be used in broader statistical analysis and insight generation that benefits all users. This includes aggregated views of creator activity, engagement trends, and content behavior across the platform.
</p>
<p>
  These insights help power the features and collective reporting tools within HumanTone. All aggregation is performed in a way that excludes personal identifiers or raw upload contents. Your contribution helps improve the platform and is required to access our services.
</p>
<p>
  From time to time, anonymized trend-level data may be used for research, internal development, or commercial insight-sharing. Such use will never involve the sale of personally identifiable data or allow third parties to reverse-engineer individual contributions.
</p>
<p>
  We do not collect or verify user age, and the platform is not intended for use by individuals under 13. By uploading, you affirm that you are not knowingly submitting data on behalf of a minor without appropriate authority or consent.
</p>

<h2>Developer API</h2>
<p>
  The HumanTone API is offered under tiered access and may be subject to rate limits or usage restrictions. Developers must use it in accordance with our published terms. Activities such as scraping, circumvention of limits, or unauthorized storage of third-party data are prohibited and may result in access being revoked.
</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>
  The insights and outputs provided by HumanTone.me are for informational purposes only. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or future availability of any features. The service is offered “as is,” and users assume all responsibility for how insights are interpreted or applied.
</p>

<h2>Modifications to Terms</h2>
<p>
  These terms may be updated periodically to reflect platform changes or legal requirements. Updates will be posted on this page, and continued use of HumanTone.me constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
